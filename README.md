# Composer template for Drupal projects using Docker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project)

This is an extended version of Drupal Composer template, with some changes/addons to get started faster and preferring some conventions.

Default will be using:
* Nginx
* PHP with FPM (separate container)
* MariaDB
* Redis
* Solr intended for Search API
* Mail catcher using Mailhog

A profile based on Minimal that enables and configures defaults to use Redis and Solr.
(This is work in progress)

## Getting started:

* Have Docker installed, including `docker-compose`
  * Recommended: use the official Docker installer if on macOS or Windows 10+
    as they provide improved file sharing
* Copy and edit as required `.env.development` to `.env` and `.salt.example` to `.salt`
* Default is the **minimal** installation. To use **standard** edit `docker/drupal/entrypoint.sh:19`
* In the project root, run `docker-compose up`
* ... First run will take some time (downloading images, doing `composer install` and installing Drupal)
* ... Please allow on first run to fully finish
* To stop hit `CTRL-C` and wait for the services to terminate (it's important!)

To use Drupal's Drush or Console in another terminal run `docker-composer exec drupal /bin/bash`
and it will allow you to interact with Drupal from the shell as expected.

Website will be available on http://localhost:8080 and secure https://localhost:8443
Admin password is autogenerated and will be seen in last few lines on initial run!
To view mail sent http://localhost:8025

## Important to know and take action:

### Mail on production must use a 3rd party system
You should use a 3rd party system like Sendgrid or Mailgun. Both have modules for Drupal and are
fully supported and also have generous free packages.

Alternative, you could add a smtp docker container to your project and use that if you are so brave
enough to fight against different spam control configuration the most important Mail services use.
To take note, this way will fail in most times to deliver to Gmail, Outlook or Yahoo, but using the above suggestion, corectly configured, delivery will be guatanteed 100% in the INBOX and not the
Spam folder.

## TODO:

* If no website is installed or no database of existing website is present in the `to_be_integrated` directory than the website will be installed automatically.
* Add a tools container based on PHP-CLI with support for Drush/Drupal Console etc.
* Add NodeJS based container to help Frontend themes builds using another best practice convention (more to be detailed soon)
* Initial documentation
* prepare alternative for production
  - app must be built in the image and not using shared folders!
    the reason is performance (actually on Linux this is barely noticeble)
  - doing builds might be concept similar to compilation in other programming languages
    might be interestring to take this aproach even in development as it would
    provide a big performance improvement on doing *site building*
* Documentation
  - Detailed documentation and workflow examples.
    possible a Youtube channel?

## Original text for Drupal Composer:

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

If you want to know how to use it as replacement for
[Drush Make](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/master/docs/make.md) visit
the [Documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2471553).

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev some-dir --stability dev --no-interaction
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your
installation.

```
cd some-dir
composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

The `composer create-project` command passes ownership of all files to the
project that is created. You should create a new git repository, and commit
all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `web`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`web/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates default writable versions of `settings.php` and `services.yml`.
* Creates `web/sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.

## Updating Drupal Core

This project will attempt to keep all of your Drupal Core files up-to-date; the
project [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold)
is used to ensure that your scaffold files are updated every time drupal/core is
updated. If you customize any of the "scaffolding" files (commonly .htaccess),
you may need to merge conflicts if any of your modified files are updated in a
new release of Drupal core.

Follow the steps below to update your core files.

1. Run `composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies` to update Drupal Core and its dependencies.
1. Run `git diff` to determine if any of the scaffolding files have changed.
   Review the files for any changes and restore any customizations to
  `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.
1. In the event that there are non-trivial conflicts in step 2, you may wish
   to perform these steps on a branch, and use `git merge` to combine the
   updated core files with your customized files. This facilitates the use
   of a [three-way merge tool such as kdiff3](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/12/how-to-setup-kdiff-as-diff-tool-for-git.html). This setup is not necessary if your changes are simple;
   keeping all of your modifications at the beginning or end of the file is a
   good strategy to keep merges easy.

## Generate composer.json from existing project

With using [the "Composer Generate" drush extension](https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_generate)
you can now generate a basic `composer.json` file from an existing project. Note
that the generated `composer.json` might differ from this project's file.


## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download?

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also
workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### Should I commit the scaffolding files?

The [drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) plugin can download the scaffold files (like
index.php, update.php, â€¦) to the web/ directory of your project. If you have not customized those files you could choose
to not check them into your version control system (e.g. git). If that is the case for your project it might be
convenient to automatically run the drupal-scaffold plugin after every install or update of your project. You can
achieve that by registering `@drupal-scaffold` as post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "drupal-scaffold": "DrupalComposer\\DrupalScaffold\\Plugin::scaffold",
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ]
},
```
### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
### How do I switch from packagist.drupal-composer.org to packages.drupal.org?

Follow the instructions in the [documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-packagesdrupalorg).
