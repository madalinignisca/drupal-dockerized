# Using Docker as a development environment for Drupal projects

Includes Nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB, Redis and Solr.

## Getting started:

* Have Docker installed, including `docker-compose`
  * Recommended: use the official Docker installer if on macOS or Windows 10+
    as they provide improved file sharing
* in the project root, run `docker-compose up`
* to stop hit `CTRL-C` and wait for the services to terminate (it's important)
